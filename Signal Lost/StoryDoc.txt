Star Wars style text crawl intro, start doing mundane specimen collection. Present day. Under the supervision of Earth. 
Galactic Alien invasion in search of resources
Aliens land, you go offline. Offline for 90 days. Emergency battery wakes you up. Seelon Husk beams you and he knows how to disable the alien craft. 
Husk tells you the main ship has a weak spot in its reactor that can be disabled by cutting a wire. 
Once you get to the reactor, big Alien Reactor Protector fights to defend the reactor. 
If you go to the weak spot, cutting the wire will detonate the reactor, thanks Seelon Husk. 
So you can choose to save Earth or continue fighting the aliens.
